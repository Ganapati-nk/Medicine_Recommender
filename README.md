# Medical Recommender System  

Developed an innovative medical recommender system leveraging machine learning techniques to predict diseases based on user-provided symptoms. Utilized a dataset containing symptom-disease mappings and employed supervised learning algorithms for accurate predictions.

## Key Features:
       -->Symptom Input: Enables users to input their symptoms through a user-friendly interface.
       -->Disease Prediction: Utilizes trained machine learning models to predict the most probable diseases corresponding to the entered 
          symptoms.
       -->Personalized Recommendations: Provides personalized recommendations tailored to predicted diseases, including medication 
         suggestions, workout routines, dietary advice, and precautionary measures.

## Technologies Used:
       --> Programming Languages: Python
       --> Frameworks/Libraries: Scikit-learn, Flask, nltk
       --> Web Technologies: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap

## Impact:
         Empowered users to proactively manage their health by providing early disease predictions and personalized recommendations, 
         potentially reducing healthcare costs and improving overall well-being.

This project showcases my expertise in machine learning, web development, and healthcare domain knowledge, along with a passion for leveraging technology to address real-world challenges in healthcare.
